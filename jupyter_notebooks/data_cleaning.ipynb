    "# Car data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will clean and prepare for analysis car price data. Here's the dictionary which explains meaning of the initial data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Car_ID**: Unique id of each observation (Interger)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Symboling**: Its assigned insurance risk rating, A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.(Categorical) \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **carCompany**: Name of car company (Categorical)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **fueltype**: Car fuel type i.e gas or diesel (Categorical)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **aspiration**: Aspiration used in a car (Categorical)\n",
    "    - 'std' refers to a naturally aspirated engine, which means it draws in air at atmospheric pressure without any extra components.\n",
    "    - 'turbo' refers to a turbocharged engine, which uses a turbine powered by exhaust gases to force more air into the engine, resulting in more power.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **doornumber**: Number of doors in a car (Categorical)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **carbody**: body of car (Categorical)\n",
    "    - 'convertible': A car with a retractable roof that can be a soft top (fabric) or a hardtop (metal).\n",
    "    - 'hatchback': A car with a rear hatch door that swings upward, combining the passenger area and cargo space.\n",
    "    - 'sedan': A car with four doors and a separate, enclosed trunk.\n",
    "    - 'wagon': Similar to a sedan but with an extended roofline that continues over a large cargo area, often with a rear liftgate.\n",
    "    - 'hardtop': A car without a pillar between the front and rear side windows, giving it a more open, airy feel when the windows are down.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **drivewheel**: type of drive wheel (Categorical)\n",
    "    - 'rwd' (Rear-Wheel Drive): Power is sent to the rear wheels. This is common in sports cars and trucks.\n",
    "    - 'fwd' (Front-Wheel Drive): Power is sent to the front wheels. This is the most common setup for passenger cars.\n",
    "    - '4wd' (Four-Wheel Drive): Power is sent to all four wheels. This is designed for better traction in off-road or slippery conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **enginelocation**: Location of car engine (Categorical)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **wheelbase**: Weelbase of car (Numeric). The distance between the center points of the front and rear wheels. A longer wheelbase generally results in a smoother ride, while a shorter wheelbase can make a car more agile.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **carlength**: Length of car (Numeric)\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **carwidth**: Width of car (Numeric)\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **carheight**: height of car (Numeric)\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **curbweight**: The weight of a car without occupants or baggage. (Numeric)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **enginetype**: Type of engine. (Categorical)\n",
    "    - 'OHC' (Overhead Cam): The camshaft is located in the cylinder head. This is the general term for this design.\n",
    "    - 'DOHC' (Dual Overhead Cam): The most common modern design, with two separate camshafts per cylinder bank—one for intake valves and one for exhaust valves. This allows for better engine breathing and more power.\n",
    "    - 'OHCV' (Overhead Cam Valve): This term is similar to OHC but emphasizes that the valves are also located in the cylinder head.\n",
    "    - 'OHCF' (Overhead Cam with F-Head): A specific and less common design where the intake valves are in the cylinder head and the exhaust valves are in the block.\n",
    "    - 'l': This likely stands for a L-head engine, an older design where the intake and exhaust valves were located side-by-side in the engine block.\n",
    "    - 'rotor': A rotary engine, which uses triangular rotors to convert pressure into rotational motion instead of pistons.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **cylindernumber**: cylinder placed in the car (Categorical). A cylinder is a chamber where fuel is combusted to generate power.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **enginesize**: Size of car (Numeric). This refers to the total volume of air and fuel an engine can draw in during one cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **fuelsystem**: Fuel system of car (Categorical). This is the method used to deliver fuel to the engine's combustion chambers.\n",
    "    - 'mpfi' (Multi-Port Fuel Injection): Each cylinder has its own fuel injector, which is the most common modern design.\n",
    "    - 'spfi' (Single-Point Fuel Injection): A single injector feeds all cylinders, typically a less efficient system than MPFI.\n",
    "    - 'mfi' (Mechanical Fuel Injection): An older system that uses mechanical pumps and injectors instead of electronic ones.\n",
    "    - 'idi' (Indirect Diesel Injection): The fuel is injected into a pre-chamber before entering the main combustion chamber.\n",
    "    - '1bbl', '2bbl', '4bbl': These refer to carburetor-based systems. bbl stands for \"barrel,\" which is a passageway in the carburetor. More barrels generally allow for more air and fuel to enter the engine, thus more power.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **boreratio**: Boreratio of car (Numeric). The bore-stroke ratio is the ratio of the cylinder's diameter (bore) to the piston's travel distance (stroke). This ratio helps determine how the engine produces power.\n",
    "20. **stroke**: Stroke or volume inside the engine (Numeric). The distance the piston travels up and down inside the cylinder. This is a critical factor in calculating the engine's displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **compressionratio**: compression ratio of car (Numeric). This is the ratio of the volume inside a cylinder when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke to the volume when the piston is at the top. A higher compression ratio can result in more power and efficiency but may require higher-octane fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **horsepower**: Horsepower (Numeric). A measurement of an engine's power output. It tells you how quickly the engine can produce force, which directly relates to a car's top speed and acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **peakrpm**: car peak rpm (Numeric). This stands for Revolutions Per Minute. It is a measure of how fast the engine crankshaft is rotating. Peak RPM is the specific engine speed at which the engine produces its maximum power.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **citympg**: Mileage in city (Numeric). It measures fuel economy under typical urban driving conditions, with frequent stops and starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **highwaympg**: Mileage on highway (Numeric). It measures fuel economy during a consistent, higher-speed drive, like on a highway, without stopping. Highway MPG is almost always higher because a car is more fuel-efficient when it doesn't have to constantly accelerate from a stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **price** (Dependent variable): Price of car (Numeric)"
